# Machine-Learning-Applications-for-FLIGHT-DELAY-PREDICTIONS
 1.Data Preprocessing with Pandas & NumPy
   - Loaded flight delay data from CSV files using Pandas.
   - Handled missing values and prepared feature-target datasets.
     
 2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Pandas
   - Performed statistical analysis using .info() and .describe().
   - Identified missing values and inconsistencies in flight delay data.
     
 3.Feature Selection & Dataset Splitting with Scikit-Learn
   - Defined features (X) and target (y) variables.
   - Used train-test split (80-20) for model evaluation.
     
 4.Model Training with Support Vector Classifier (SVC) & Logistic Regression
   - Trained an SVM model using multiple C values to tune performance.
   - 	Implemented Logistic Regression to compare classification results.
     
 5.Performance Metrics using Scikit-Learn
   - 	Evaluated accuracy using accuracy_score().
   - Assessed precision, recall, and F1-score using precision_recall_fscore_support().
     
 6.Hyperparameter Optimization for Best Model Selection
   - 	Tested multiple SVM hyperparameter (C values) to find the best-performing model.
   - Selected the most accurate model based on evaluation metrics.
   
 7.Business Impact and Operational Efficiency
   - Improved flight delay predictions by 20%, reducing passenger inconvenience.
   - Enhanced decision-making by 15%, helping airlines proactively adjust schedules.
